This project contains various Spring Boot microservices which allow for CRUD operations on various data regarding my professional experience, as well as some simple projects to for me to play with, such as an 8-Puzzle solver. I'm hoping by demonstrating my initiative and ability to create and deploy simple services such as these it will help with my job prospects.

These microservices utilize Spring JPA and connect to a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS for object persistance (basically an easy way to update and display my relavent work experience, education and skills dynamically on my website).

All of these services were created entirely by myself with the exception of the s3-bucket-service. Credit goes to Gustavo Miranda on Medium whose tutorial can be found here https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/aws-s3-with-java-using-spring-boot-7f6fcf734aec.
